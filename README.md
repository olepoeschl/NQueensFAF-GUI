-------------------


# Version 1: 
      - board as NxN-boolean
      
      - occupy each square individually
      
      - single threading only
      
      - N=16 in ~ 10 minutes
      
      
# Version 2:
      - reduce to half by only going to the half of the first row
      
      - N = 16 in ~ 5 min
      
# Version 3:
      - represent the board with diagonals and cols 
      
      - N = 16 in ~ some min
      
# Version 4:
      - multithreading by setting Queen in the first row on different places
      
# Version 5:
      - bether use of symmetry of solutions by using starting constelaions
      
      - set Queens on the outer rows and cols
      
      - multithreading by distributing the starting positions to the threads
      
      - N=16 in ~ 1 min (single)
      
# Version 6:
      - bit representation of integers for modelling the board
      
      - rest of the program stays the same
      
      - has a gui now
      
      - N = 16 in ~ 4 sec (single)
      
# Version 7:
      - many minor changes to reduce memory and cache misses
      
      - ability to save progress and continue later
      
      - use newest java jdk 15
      
      - N= 16 in ~2.5 sec (single)
      
# Version 8 (yet to come):
      - definitely N=16 in < 1 sec (single)
