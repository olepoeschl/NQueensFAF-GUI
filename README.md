# NQueensFAF
<!--img src="https://www.student.hs-mittweida.de/~opoeschl/data/queenFire_FAF.png" width="200" height="200" align="right" /-->

A really fast and highly optimized program for calculating the number of solutions of the N-Queens problem. Can be used with a gui or via command line.
<br>Supports CPU multithreading and GPU.

NOTE: The newest version is always tested for integrated Intel GPUs and for NVIDIA GPUs. 
The latest working version for AMD is release 1.14.1. We are currently working on the compatibility with AMD GPUs.

See the "Release" section for the latest build.

# Current Benchmarks
During the time we have spent developing this program, we have been able to continuously expand our available hardware. 
Especially the newer graphics cards show the potential of our program. 
We are looking forward to the distributed project and hope to solve the 26-queens problem until January 2023 with your help!

Single stands for single core and multi for Multi-Core. 
The CPU's and the GPU's are used with stock settings. 

Attention: when testing times on GPU, your graphics card may go into another power state. To check this and avoid this, you can use a tool such as "nvidiainfo".

# News 

We have adapted the architecture of the solvers for the distributed version. 
It only remains to add some code for distributing the workloads properly to users with different hardware. 

# General

This solution is based on two methods and one idea:

- using bits to represent the occupancy of the board; based on the <a href="http://users.rcn.com/liusomers/nqueen_demo/nqueens.html">implementation by Jeff Somers </a>
      
- calculating start constellations, in which the borders of the board are already occupied by 3 or 4 queens; based on the <a href="https://github.com/preusser/q27">implementation by the TU Dresden</a> (a very good description of this method can be found <a href="http://www.nqueens.de/sub/SearchAlgoUseSymm.en.html">here</a>)

- GPU: remember board-leaving diagonals, when going forward, so that they can be reinserted, when we go backwards. This has also been done in Ping Che Chen's implementation (https://forum.beyond3d.com/threads/n-queen-solver-for-opencl.47785/) of the N Queens Problem for GPU's and it reduces the use of memory. 

# Versions
This section shows the improvements we made from version to version related to the performance.
Unless its stated otherwise, following times are referring to *single-threaded* and the i5-9300h mentioned above.

## Distributed (yet to come):
      - we already had a working version, but it was only for cpu and due to new ideas and requirements, we started again from zero and reprogram the whole application
     
      - currently developing a system for distributing the workloads as efficent as possible, so that CPU's and GPU's of all classes can contribute usefully

      - we aim to have a working prototype until December 2022, official release will probably be in early 2023
   
      - there will be a website with a ranking of all participants and the current progress of the project when it runs
     
We are very excited!

## 1.17 (latest):
      - GPU speed up of approximately 35% 
      - prepared the CPU Solver for the distributed version 
      - saving and restoring is now 10 times faster 
      - number of preset queens is now configurable 
      - now also showing the passed time in the command line version 
## 1.16:
      - implemented SymSolver for finding solutions that are symmetric with respect to 90 or 180 degree rotation 
      - enable counting of unique solutions 
      - extend capabilities of the command line version, for example auto saves, unique solution counter and config file 
## 1.15:
      - migrated from LWJGL 2 to LWJGL 3 -> much less overhead when starting the GpuSolver
      - for low board sizes, noticeably faster times
## 1.14:
      - command line support
## 1.13:
      - BIG IMPROVEMENT in GPU-Solver (about 30%)
      
      - swapped j with k in GpuConstellationsGenerator
      
      - group constellations by j, putting them into the same OpenCL workgroup
      
      - reduced overhead of starting the GPU-Solver by using a better method of filling the workgroups with "pseudo" constellations
## 1.12:
      - the OpenCL workgroup size used by the GpuSolver is now editable
      
      - some small changes to the Gpu Solver with little improvement
      
      - some new Gui features
## 1.11:
      - splitted into the Gui program (this repo) and the NQueensFAF library for the computation part 
      
      - the GPU solver now rounds the global work size up to the next matching number of constellations 
        and solves all constellations using GPU instead of solving remaing constellations using CPU
        
      - code (especially of the Gui class) is much cleaner now
## 1.10:
      - included support for GPU's using OpenCL through lwjgl
      
      - insanely fast thanks to optimized parallel programming
      
      - realtime progress updates using OpenCL read operations
## 1.9:
      - REMARKABLE IMPROVEMENT!!! (~35%)

      - implemented case distinction for the different start Constellations in order to get rid of arrays
      
      - now only 0 - 3 class variables (int) per start constellation instead of int[N-3] and 5 int
      
      - currently only works for board sizes up to N=23, this will be updated soon
      
      - N = 16 in ~1.35 sec --> broke the 2-second-Barrier!
## 1.8:
      - better handling of the different start constellation cases
      
      - optimization of the recursion functions
      
      - many further little optimizations

      - N = 16 in ~2.1 sec
## 1.7:
      - many minor changes to reduce memory and cache misses
      
      - ability to save progress and continue later
      
      - use newest java jdk 15
      
      - N = 16 in ~2.5 sec
## 1.6:
      - bit representation of integers for modelling the board
      
      - rest of the program stays the same
      
      - has a gui now
      
      - N = 16 in ~ 4 sec
## 1.5:
      - better use of symmetry of solutions by using starting constellations
      
      - set Queens on the outer rows and cols
      
      - multithreading by distributing the starting positions to the threads
      
      - N = 16 in ~ 1 min     
## 1.4:
      - multithreading by setting Queen in the first row on different places
## 1.3:
      - represent the board with diagonals and cols 
      
      - N = 16 in ~ some min
## 1.2:
      - reduce to half by only going to the half of the first row
      
      - N = 16 in ~ 5 min
## 1.1 (actually 1.0): 
      - board as NxN-boolean
      
      - occupy each square individually
      
      - single threading only
      
      - N = 16 in ~ 10 minutes
